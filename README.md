* Hi, I'm Joseph (“Joe”) Diego
* I'm interested in AI/ML, robotics/autonomy, embedded systems, and space systems (CubeSats)
* I'm currently learning C/C++, Linux/Bash, data structures, machine learning fundamentals, and core EE topics (circuits, signals/systems, basic controls)
* I'm originally from Guam
* I'm a Junior in Electrical Engineering
* I chose my major because I want to build intelligent machines—robots and space systems—by combining hardware (circuits/embedded) with software (AI)
* A fun fact about me is: I’m a U.S. Air Force veteran (formerly Staff Sergeant)
* What do I want to learn from EE 205? Strong C/C++ foundations for engineers, OOP basics, data structures/algorithms, and real confidence using Linux/Bash + Git to build larger projects
* A book or movie I'd recommend is: I haven’t had much time for books/movies lately due to school, but I recommend the “Diary of a CEO” podcast on YouTube for thoughtful conversations on leadership, learning, and mindset.
